About:
Home-In-A-Box is built around the idea that even the most inexperienced builder can assemble and create their own custom tiny home with the right guidance and instruction. It’s not for everyone, of course - In this day and age, not everyone has the time to spend building their own tiny home, and we know this: hence why we have several standard, pre-assembled tiny home models for sale. Our favorite thing to do, though, is to handle all the hard stuff for you, like working out design kinks, gathering materials, and drafting build plans. We love to leave the best part for you: assembling your new tiny house.
