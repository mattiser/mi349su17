Rule of thirds:
The landing page of Appleâ€™s website, apple.com, is divided into three distinct rows: The head row, with an advertisement for a product, 
the second row with several other options, and the third row with different areas of the website listed in columns. 
This fulfills the rule of thirds.

Signal-to-noise ratio:
The landing page of Reddit.com is a fabulous example of having too much noise on a website page. The entire site hurts the eyes - it's
not well designed from a viewing standpoint.

Modularity:
Nytimes.com is a good example of modularity, right from the landing page. The home page is divided into several headings,
right off the bat, where you might look to find a news story of interest. Beneath that, the home page also lists
many news stories of relevance and potential interest.

Ockham's Razor
Weebly.com has a very user-friendly, attractive, simple interface, created for the purpose of persuading the viewer to build a 
website with Weebly. Its design embraces and showcases this.

Hick's Law
Cnn.com, like nytimes.com, has a large amount of information right on the landing page. CNN designs their website this way to grab
your attention to multiple things at once, so that the viewer is more likely to stay on the website longer browsing different stories.
