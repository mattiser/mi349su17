Upon reflecting on style tiles vs. mock ups, I personally felt like I spent less time on the mock up itself
than I spent on the style tiles. This may have been because I was able to get my thoughts in order with the style tiles and
it may have made it easier for me to create my mock up after organizing those, but I still believe I had an easier time
with the mock up in comparison. That may not always be the case - perhaps, if I try to do a mock up before style tiles, I won't
have such an easy time with it. The only way to tell is by trying it again in the future to find out which style suits me best.

I did like the style tiles because it helped me get my thoughts together on which design I wanted and how I wanted it to flow. I
don't think I need to make my style tiles quite as detailed as I did (I used a template) in the future, but it was overall a helpful
experience.
